# Introducing getgb.io

In April 2015 I gave a presentation to the GDG Berlin meetup group (slides, video) discussing my views on reproducible builds using the Go programming language.

As part of that presentation I demonstrated a replacement build tool that I had been developing, `gb`.

From the feedback I received after the meetup it was clear that many people understood and agreed with my reasoning why reproducible builds in Go are a problem today. However it was equally clear that I had not done a good enough job of explaining how `gb` works, and why I felt it was necessary to create an alternative build tool to solve the problem of reproducible builds.

With the help of the go-pm mailing list and the feedback from a group of early adopters of `gb`, I have put together a website for `gb` with expanded documentation and examples.
