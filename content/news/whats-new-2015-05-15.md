What's new in gb this week ?

<!--more-->

## gb-list

An initial cut of `gb-list` has landed. `gb-list` is similar to `go list` and allows you to interrogate gb projects.

## gb build -ldflags

Support for the `-ldflags` flag has landed. This flag is useful for setting variables at link time, such as git revisions.
<pre>% <b>cat src/hello/hello.go</b>
package main
import "fmt"
var msg string
func main() {
        fmt.Println(msg)
}
% <b>gb build -ldflags "-X main.msg 'Hello from gb'"</b>
hello
% <b>bin/hello</b>
Hello from gb</pre>

## cgo still not supported, but at least we give a decent error message

cgo support is still in the works. In the interim, gb will give a decent error message.
<pre>% <b>gb build</b>
FATAL command "build" failed: github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3: cgo not suppored, see https://github.com/constabulary/gb/issues/12</pre>
