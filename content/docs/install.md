## Prerequisites

`gb` is compatible with Go 1.4. If you haven't installed Go yet, we recommend using the binary installers available from the [official Go website](http://golang.org/doc/install#install).

## Installation

`gb` can be installed with the following command:

<pre><b>go get github.com/constabulary/gb/...</b></pre>

## Keeping Up To Date

`gb` is under active development, you can upgrade your `gb` installation to the latest with the following command:

<pre><b>go get -u github.com/constabulary/gb/...</b></pre>

## Multiple versions of Go

Your `gb` installation is tightly coupled to the version of Go that built it. If you have multiple versions of Go installed, you will have to build a version of `gb` for each version installed.

## Next Up

Now you've installed `gb`, move on to [setting up your project](/docs/project).
